        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Kaley Kim. I am currently a third year majoring in Sociology at the University of California Riverside. <br><br>

        I grew up in Los Angeles, California for majority of my life. I have worked a total of three part time, customer service jobs. My 4-year experience with customer service has allowed me to become more socially adaptable. My other strong suits include being a detail oriented, but quick-witted person. I am able to work efficiently when the pressure of a time crunch is existent. In the future, I want to develop approaches to the solution of group problems, based on research findings in sociology and other related disciplines. Moreover, I would love to develop problem intervention procedures, using techniques such as interviews, consultations, role playing and participant observation of group interactions. I will take my skills to implement collective ideas to sponsor campus and community events which promote educational and social changes. My position as a research analyze assistant at a corporate food company, has granted me leadership skills, and has led me to discuss success skills, business ethics and one on one personal finances with the employees there.   <br><br>

        Overall, I am a Sociology major seeking to use research and interactive experiences with my role as a resource analyze assistant at Junior Research Associate at 85 Bakery. I beleive my fast learning abilities, commitment to succeed and relevant studies have aided my abilities to network with ease. I am also awarded with multiple honors based merits and expected to graduate with a B.A in Sociology from the University of California Riverside in June of 2023. I am also dedicated to a career working with people of all ranges. I hold excellent people skills and have a good understanding of community resources. I am comfortable working with diverse populations, and possess strong problem solving skills. Later on with my major, I hope to participate in extensive research for around 3-5 years. This research will center around planning and conducting research studies and experiments to test and validate theories about societal issues; developing and implementing methods of data collection (e.g questionnaires, observations, and interviews). With this data, I hope to assert my skills in observing group interactions and role affiliations in order to collect further data, and to identify problems. Furthermore, with these skills, I hope to work together with teams in order to come up with environmental solutions in order to analyze the human social behavior. In a more professional stance, I hope to take these findings and prepare publications and reports based on such research. Other goals I have in mind with my major are to plan and conduct research to develop and test theories about societal issues such as crime, group relations, poverty, aging and societal class gaps.I am also looking forward to directly working with statistical clerks, statisticians and others who compile and evaluate research data.Further down in my career path, I hope to consult with and advise individuals such as administrators, social workers and legislators regarding social issues and policies as well as the implications of research findings.
